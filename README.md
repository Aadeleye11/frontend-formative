# Personal Portfolio Website

This is a responsive personal resume website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It’s a simple project that showcases my skills, projects, education background, and contact details in a clean, user-friendly layout. I built this as part of a course assessment, but also to serve as a foundation for future opportunities and professional networking.

## Features

- Fully responsive layout — works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Custom CSS styling without any frameworks
- Interactive elements (dot animation, hover effects)
- Semantic HTML and clean, readable structure
- Deployed live using GitHub Pages

## Sections Included

- **Home** – quick intro and links to socials
- **What I Do** – short, categorized breakdown of services I offer
- **Skills** – a horizontal slider showing tools I work with
- **Projects & Experience** – where I've applied my skills
- **Contact** – form with a neat layout for reaching out

## Tech Stack

- HTML5

## Notes

This was built without templates or CSS frameworks, and I didn’t use any libraries for styling or layout. The goal was to demonstrate an understanding of web structure, responsiveness, and personal branding.
